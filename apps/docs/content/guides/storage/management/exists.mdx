To determine if an object exists in a bucket, use the `exists` method.
RLS is applied to this method, meaning that the user must have the `read` permission on the object to check if it exists.

```javascript
const { data, error } = await supabase.storage.from('bucket_name').exists('path/your/object.png')

console.log(data) // true or false
```

## Consistency Guarantees
Storage provides [strong read-after-write consistency](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/consistency/) for object existence checks. When the object is uploaded or deleted, the `exists` method will return the correct result immediately.
